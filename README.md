# Proof of Work Chain

This was [Chainshot](https://www.chainshot.com/) bootcamp's week 2 exercise to build your own proof of work blockchain in using JavaScript. I managed to get a simple react front end going and the ability to send transactions between 3 accounts. The blockchain mines in 10 second intervals.

# Installation Steps
```
cd PoW-Chain
yarn install
node index # Run Express backend
# In new tab,
cd client
npm start
```
